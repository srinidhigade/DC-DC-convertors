# convertors 
Buck and Boost convertors are commonly known as dc-dc convertors which are used in suppling power to auxiliaries of EV depending upon duty ratio by increasing output voltage in boost convertor and decreasing output voltage in buck convertor .  
Rectifiers and Invertors are other two types of convertors which helps in converting AC-DC and DC-AC which are also used in electric vehicles at different stages of conversion.
